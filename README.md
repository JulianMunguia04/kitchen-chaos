# Kitchen Chaos 🍳🔥

This is a Unity 3D game project called **Kitchen Chaos**.

⚠️ This project is part of a **tutorial series** I’m following to learn Unity game development. The game is inspired by *Overcooked* and is being built while following an online course.

## 📌 About

**Kitchen Chaos** is currently a learning project.
